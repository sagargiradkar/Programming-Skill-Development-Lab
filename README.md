# Embedded Systems Laboratory Assignments

## Overview

This repository contains laboratory assignments for an Embedded Systems course. The assignments are divided into two groups, A and B, each focusing on different aspects of Embedded C programming. Additionally, the repository includes mappings of course outcomes (CO) to each assignment to help students understand the learning objectives.

### Group A Assignments (Choose any Three)

#### 1. Study of Embedded C Programming Language
- Overview and syntax of Embedded C
- Implementation of a simple program (e.g., addition of two numbers)

#### 2. Embedded C Program to Add Array of n Numbers
- Implementation of a program to add an array of 'n' numbers

#### 3. Embedded C Program for Memory Transfers
- Internal to internal memory transfer
- Internal to external memory transfer

#### 4. Embedded C Menu Driven Program
- Multiply 8-bit numbers
- Divide 8-bit numbers

#### 5. Embedded C Program for Sorting
- Sorting numbers in ascending and descending order

### Group B Assignments (Choose any Three)

#### 6. Embedded C Program for PIC 18FXXX LED Interface
- Interface PIC 18FXXX with LED
- Implement blinking using specified delay

#### 7. Embedded C Program for Timer Programming
- Use ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) for buzzer on/off based on a timer

#### 8. Embedded C Program for External Interrupt
- Detect input switch press using external interrupt
- Control relay output based on switch press

#### 9. Embedded C Program for LCD Interfacing
- Interface LCD with PIC 18FXXX

## Course Outcome Mapping

### Group A
- **CO1:** Understanding and applying Embedded C programming concepts
- **CO2:** Developing skills in memory operations, menu-driven programming, and sorting algorithms

### Group B
- **CO3:** Implementing interfacing techniques for PIC 18FXXX with LEDs, timers, external interrupts, and LCDs

## Getting Started

To get started with these assignments, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/embedded-systems-lab.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the respective assignment folder (e.g., `GroupA/Assignment1`).

3. Review the assignment description and code files.

4. Complete the assignments by adding your code to the provided templates.

5. Test your code on an appropriate development environment or hardware platform.

6. Update the README.md file in each assignment folder with any additional instructions or notes.
